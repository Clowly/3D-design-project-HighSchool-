        <p><mark>I created this world based of off a game I played for 2+ years, it was a 2D game so I tried to recreate the 3D version of a scene from the game, but it still lacks in a lot of places. In addition, I added my own ideas that was different from the game.</mark></p>
        <P><mark>My world is more of a site seeing world than an game world with interactions. Free free to move around as I placed alot of different things through out the map to explore. Infront of you once you login is my most proud creation in this project, a japanese aircraft carrier from WWII, behind you is a large scorpion that I created during my junior year. Behind that is the academy that took the longest to build. There are also seagulls flying in the distance. Feel free to refresh the page as you get to see different weather, such as sunny, rainy, snowy and even cherry petal falling!!! If you look down infront of you, you will see 3 white boxes, that plays music so you won't be bored while exploring(WARNING: MUSIC IS LOUD SO BEWARE). As you can see there are alot of trees in this world, feel free to click on it to change the color and see petals falling down. I also placed easter egg(Yea I know it's not easter yet, but whatever) around the map. They are in shape of boxes with firework design, so click on it to find out yourself.</mark> </P>
